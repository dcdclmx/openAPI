    Welcome to the ShipSaving Open API documentation.

    This API allows you to:
    - Create and manage orders
    - Retrieve shipping rates
    - Purchase and void shipping labels
    - Generate SCAN forms for USPS and DHL
    - Access account and carrier information

    # ðŸ”– General Instructions:
    - **Authentication**: All endpoints require an `api_token` passed as a query parameter.
    - **Base URL**: `https://api.shipsaving.com/api`
    - **Format**: All request/response payloads use `application/json`.
    - **Rate Limiting**: Each endpoint may have rate limits (e.g., 900 req/min for `/rates/list`).
    - **Error Handling**: HTTP 4xx/5xx errors include a `message` field in the response body.

    Refer to each endpoint for required parameters, field descriptions, and usage notes.
